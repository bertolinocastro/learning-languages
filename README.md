Default design setup for canva.com web-application projects:

Text in language of origin: {
  font: Quicksand Light;
  color: #f13223;
  style: bold;
}

Text in target language: {
  font: Ovo;
  color: #000000;
}

Title: {
  font: Shadow Into Light;
  color: #737373;
}

Country's flag of origin language centered at upper-left margin corner
Country's flag of target language centered at upper-right margin corner

Title centered at upper margin

Main text roughly centered inside the full area delimited by margins

Translation or target text/explanation lower-aligned to the area delimiter by margins. Preference in approximating the right border of this text box to the right end of the whole image (thus leaving free space at the left side)

Pages that are not cover-pages may have just one of the type of texts (origin language or target language, for example)

The title may be composed of the following keywords:

- in Portuguese:
  - frase
  - vocabul√°rio
  - esporte e lazer
  - adverbio
- in German:
- in English:

#### TODO:

Define more new categories of images. So we can easily determine which content the chain of images will refer to.
