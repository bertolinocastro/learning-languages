## !!! ALERT: this repo is yet in process of creation. Everything is yet being set up. !!!

Here I'll try to show roughly how I do/create my posts on my Instagram page dedicated for my process of learning. Here you will also find the source of texts and images found on my page. They won't match ipisis litteris. They will also not be 100% correct, since I'm not a teacher, just a student.

I'm always open to receive corrections or questions. Please do so! That's part of the learning process and I'll be happy to share knowledge with everyone.

Default design setup for canva.com web-application projects:

Text in language of origin: {
  font: Quicksand Light;
  color: #f13223;
  style: bold;
}

Text in target language: {
  font: Ovo;
  color: #000000;
}

Title: {
  font: Shadow Into Light;
  color: #737373;
}

On-image Comments: {
  font: Oregano;
  color: #ff914d;
}

Country's flag of origin language centered at upper-left margin corner
Country's flag of target language centered at upper-right margin corner

Title centered at upper margin

Main text roughly centered inside the full area delimited by margins

Translation or target text/explanation lower-aligned to the area delimiter by margins. Preference in approximating the right border of this text box to the right end of the whole image (thus leaving free space at the left side)

Pages that are not cover-pages may have just one of the type of texts (origin language or target language, for example)

On-image Comments in the cover-page preferentially should be left aligned with the left upper flag and vertical aligned with the bottom-margin
On-image Comments in else pages may come everywhere

The title may be composed of the following keywords:

- in Portuguese:
  - frase
  - vocabul√°rio
  - esporte e lazer
  - adverbio
- in German:
- in English:

#### TODO:

Define more new categories of images. So we can easily determine which content the chain of images will refer to.
